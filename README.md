### How to run

```
python3 game.py

```
or

```
python3 game.py textcase2.txt

```

* If not provide a test case file, it will use "testcase1.txt".
* It also support older version python.

### Test cases

The first 3 cases are from the "PROBLEM.MD".

* testcase4.txt: The application should discard MOVE, LEFT, RIGHT and REPORT commands in the sequence until a valid PLACE command has been executed.
* testcase5.txt: PLACE command can be executed multiple times.
* testcase6.txt: REPORT multiple times.
* testcase7.txt: Any move that would cause the robot to fall must be ignored.
* testcase8.txt: Robot must not fall off the table during the initial placement.
